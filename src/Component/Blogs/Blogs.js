MongoDB is intended to figure with massive Scale knowledge. MongoDB will work on multiple servers. MongoDB will handle a large variety of access requests simply. There are a pair of style patterns in programming. One is asynchronous programming and therefore the different is synchronous programming. Node JS by default follows the Asynchronous pattern. That is, it doesn't anticipate a task to be completed. within the meanwhile, NodeJS started another job. That’s why we tend to use nodeJS.

                            SQL pronounced as “S-Q-L” or as “See-Quel” is primarily called RDBMS or Relational Databases whereas NoSQL is a Non-relational or Distributed Database.
                            Comparing SQL vs NoSQL database, SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases can be document based, key-value pairs, graph databases.
                            SQL databases are vertically scalable while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
                            SQL databases have a predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases use dynamic schema for unstructured data.
                            Comparing NoSQL vs SQL performance, SQL requires specialized DB hardware for better performance while NoSQL uses commodity hardware.
